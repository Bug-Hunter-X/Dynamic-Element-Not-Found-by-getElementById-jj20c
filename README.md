This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to dynamically adding elements and using getElementById. The bug occurs when a script attempts to access an element using getElementById before the element has been fully parsed and added to the DOM. This can happen if the script is placed in the <head> section or if the element's insertion is delayed.  The solution involves ensuring that the script runs after the element exists in the DOM, this is done through event listeners and/or moving the script block after the element in the HTML file.
